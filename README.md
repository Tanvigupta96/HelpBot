Whatsapp BOT:
(Using python)
On one end of a conversation we are replacing a user with a Whatsapp bot.
A Bot is any program which can automatedly reply to any msg
Basically a server application that is continuously running on the web
Just to provide a call back url the actually respond to ur msgs(user).
A SANDBOX is a constricted development environment. every sandbox gets a funky name on twilio.lets say we selected to use whstapp on twilio then we get a whstapp sandbox. 
Then we can connect our sandbox to the server application. That can help in communication.

Twilio: provides a way to create and test your WhatsApp bot
In a development environment.


Dialogflow:Making the bot intelligent. By making it a conversational bot.
We use a conversational engine that can be trained to give reply to specific queries in a specific manner: using Dialogflow (developed by google) 
You can ask for news(belong to any category and place), weather(any city), restaurant information(any city) and movies reviews from the bot.
