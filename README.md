**Whatsapp BOT:**
(Using python)
On one end of a conversation we are replacing a user with a Whatsapp bot.
A Bot is any program which can automatedly reply to any msg
Basically a server application that is continuously running on the web

Just to provide a call back url the actually respond to ur msgs(user).

A **SANDBOX** is a constricted development environment. every sandbox gets a funky name on twilio.lets say we selected to use whstapp on twilio then we get a whstapp sandbox. 
Then we can connect our sandbox to the server application. That can help in communication.

**Twilio:** provides a way to create and test your WhatsApp bot
In a development environment.


**Dialogflow:** Making the bot intelligent. By making it a conversational bot.
We use a conversational engine that can be trained to give reply to specific queries in a specific manner: using Dialogflow (developed by google)

You can ask for 
1)news(belong to any category and place), 
2)weather(any city),

*Many new featrues can be added and the bot can be trained using intents depending on entities.we can design and train the bot according to the information we need in day to day life.*
